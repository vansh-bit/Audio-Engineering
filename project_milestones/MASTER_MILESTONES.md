# Master Milestones Specification: Two-Phase Execution Architecture

```
================================================================================
FIRST EVALUATION COMPLETION POINT: MILESTONE 3
================================================================================
At the completion of Milestone 3, the team has satisfied the first evaluation
requirements: data strategy, model selection, evaluation methodology, and a
concrete working demonstration/result.
================================================================================
```

## Strategic Phase Split

To align with the professor's formal evaluation requirements while building a world-class AI engineering system, the project execution is explicitly divided into two phases:

* **PHASE A — FIRST EVALUATION (Milestones M0 through M3)**:
  - Focused strictly on satisfying the first academic checkpoint (3–4 minute flash talk, 1–2 slides, concrete working demonstration).
  - Delivers: (1) Data strategy, (2) Model architecture selection, (3) Evaluation methodology with SI-SDR, (4) Concrete working Stage 1 Demucs demonstration, and (5) Presentation slide package.
* **PHASE B — POST-EVALUATION / FULL PROJECT EXECUTION (Milestones M4 through M12)**:
  - Downstream pipeline stages, deep acoustic modeling, cross-stage error analysis, and full system optimization.
  - Delivers: Full multi-speaker diarization, regional Hinglish ASR, guardrailed LLM structuring, end-to-end integration, error cascade study, system benchmark notebook, real-world radio validation, and resume/portfolio packaging.

# ==============================================================================
# PHASE A — FIRST EVALUATION (M0 to M3)
# ==============================================================================

## Milestone M0: Project Scope, Data & Evaluation Design

### 1. Objective
Establish exactly what problem we are solving, what data we will use, what models we will test, and how success will be measured, setting up the foundation for the first evaluation presentation.

### 2. Why it Exists
To provide clear, defensible answers to the first three core questions asked by the professor:
1. *What data are we using?*
2. *What models/approaches have we selected?*
3. *How will we evaluate them?*

### 3. Core Problem Definition
The system targets chaotic Indian conversational speech characterized by:
* Multiple concurrent speakers with overlapping speech turns.
* Severe non-stationary ambient noise (market babble, agricultural machinery, street traffic) recorded on uncalibrated, low-cost microphones.
* Dynamic intra-sentential code-switching between regional languages and English.
* **Primary Controlled Linguistic Focus**: **Hindi-English (Hinglish)**. Broader Indian languages (Bengali, Marathi, Tamil) remain architectural extension targets for Phase B.

### 4. Data Strategy Definition
* **Corpus Selection & Utility**:
  - `IndicVoices` (AI4Bharat): Source for clean single-speaker Hinglish/Hindi reference utterances.
  - `Nirantar` (AI4Bharat): Source for natural conversational turns and dialogues.
  - `AIR-RS-DB` (All India Radio): Source for authentic broadcast debate snippets.
  - `Project Vaani` (IISc/ARTPARK): Deferred to Phase B for dialectal stress-testing.
* **Audio Standard**: Uniform 16,000 Hz, 16-bit mono PCM `.wav`.
* **Controlled Mixture Concept**:
  $$\mathbf{x}(t) = \mathbf{s}_A(t) + \alpha \mathbf{s}_B(t - \tau) + \mathbf{n}(t)$$
  Two clean reference stems mixed at calibrated overlap percentages ($\Omega \in \{0\%, 25\%, 50\%, 75\%\}$) and Signal-to-Interference Ratios ($\text{SIR} \in \{0\text{ dB}, \pm 6\text{ dB}\}$).

### 5. Model Architecture Selection
* **Stage 1 (Separation)**: **Meta's Demucs (`htdemucs`)** as primary generative model (hybrid time-frequency U-Net preserving vocal formants); **Conv-TasNet** documented as backup comparison.
* **Stage 2 (Diarization)**: `pyannote.audio` neural embeddings + Spectral Clustering / GMM (Planned for Phase B).
* **Stage 3 (Regional ASR)**: AI4Bharat `IndicWav2Vec` / `IndicASR` (Planned for Phase B).
* **Stage 4 (LLM)**: Modular provider interface (`BaseLLMProvider`) using fast API endpoints (Groq / OpenAI) during development, with local quantized Airavata 7B as a future experiment (Planned for Phase B).

### 6. Evaluation Framework Definition
* **Stage 1 (Immediate Focus)**: **Scale-Invariant Signal-to-Distortion Ratio (SI-SDR)**:
  $$\text{SI-SDR} = 10 \log_{10} \left( \frac{\|\mathbf{s}_{\text{target}}\|^2}{\|\mathbf{e}_{\text{noise}}\|^2} \right)$$
  Evaluated with **Permutation Invariant Training (PIT)** matching to ensure output channel permutations do not register false failures. Higher SI-SDR indicates superior separation.
* **Future Metrics (Phase B)**: Diarization Error Rate (DER) for Stage 2, Word Error Rate (WER) with Indic normalization for Stage 3, Hallucination Rate and ROUGE-L for Stage 4, and Real-Time Factor (RTF) for system compute.

### 7. Definition of Done (DoD)
- [x] Project scope, problem definition, and primary Hinglish focus are formally documented.
- [x] Selected data sources (`IndicVoices`, `Nirantar`, `AIR-RS-DB`) are documented with acoustic rationale.
- [x] Model selection for all 4 stages is finalized and documented.
- [x] Evaluation methodology (SI-SDR, PIT matching, future DER/WER) is defined mathematically.
- [x] Foundation repository structure and environment are operational (M0 verification report completed).

## Milestone M1: Controlled Data Pipeline

### 1. Objective
Build a small, clean, and completely reproducible controlled dataset containing single-speaker reference recordings, parameterized multi-speaker mixtures, and verified ground-truth metadata.

### 2. Why it Exists
Real-world radio recordings lack clean isolated speaker stems, making mathematical calculation of SI-SDR impossible on raw broadcasts alone. M1 provides the ground-truth foundation required for the Stage 1 demonstration.

### 3. Inputs & Outputs
* **Inputs**: Clean single-speaker audio slices from `IndicVoices` and `Nirantar` (Hindi/Hinglish).
* **Outputs**:
  - `data/controlled_eval_suite/clean_sources/`: Clean single-speaker reference tracks (`speaker_A.wav`, `speaker_B.wav`, etc.).
  - `data/controlled_eval_suite/synthetic_mixtures/`: Controlled mixture tracks (`mix_01_overlap25.wav`, `mix_02_overlap50.wav`, etc.).
  - `data/manifests/controlled_ground_truth.json`: JSON manifest mapping each mixture to its exact constituent stems, overlap duration, SIR, and speaker IDs.

### 4. Implementation Tasks
* [ ] Curate 4–6 clean single-speaker slices (male and female speakers, Hindi/Hinglish speech).
* [ ] Implement `src/preprocessing/mixture_generator.py` synthesizing overlapping mixtures:
  - Configurable overlap levels: 25% (natural turn boundary interjection) and 50% (conversational overlap).
  - Configurable relative volumes: $\text{SIR} = 0\text{ dB}$ (equal volume) and $+6\text{ dB}$ (dominant talker).
* [ ] Implement peak normalization to prevent digital clipping ($[-1.0, +1.0]$ bounds).
* [ ] Generate and serialize `data/manifests/controlled_ground_truth.json`.
* [ ] Verify that sample mixtures can be played back and listened to cleanly.

### 5. Definition of Done (DoD)
- [ ] At least 3 distinct controlled mixtures exist with known clean ground-truth stems.
- [ ] Ground-truth audio files are saved in uniform 16 kHz 16-bit mono `.wav` format.
- [ ] Metadata manifest (`controlled_ground_truth.json`) links mixtures to exact constituent source files.
- [ ] Controlled mixture generator script is fully reproducible via a single CLI command with fixed random seed.
- [ ] Audio playback verified: clean acoustic separation between speakers is audibly discernible in the ground-truth files.

---

## Milestone M2: Stage 1 Source Separation Prototype

### 1. Objective
Implement the first genuinely working deep learning component of the pipeline: Meta's pre-trained Demucs (`htdemucs`), run inference on controlled mixtures, isolate overlapping talkers into separate audio channels, and compute quantitative SI-SDR metrics with Permutation Invariant Training (PIT) matching.

### 2. Why it Exists
Fulfills the core technical demonstration required for the first evaluation: proving that deep generative models can isolate overlapping conversational speech, and providing the first concrete quantitative result.

### 3. Inputs & Outputs
* **Inputs**: Controlled mixture `.wav` files from M1.
* **Outputs**:
  - Separated single-speaker audio files (`outputs/first_eval_demo/separated_speaker_1.wav`, `separated_speaker_2.wav`).
  - Separation manifest (`separation_manifest.json`) logging energy ratios.
  - Quantitative evaluation report logging measured **SI-SDR (dB)** for each source stem.
  - Computational metrics: inference runtime, audio duration, and Real-Time Factor (RTF).

### 4. Implementation Tasks
* [ ] Implement `DemucsSeparator` in `src/separation/demucs_wrapper.py` wrapping pre-trained `htdemucs`.
* [ ] Implement audio pre-processing and post-processing (resampling to model rate, writing 16 kHz output stems).
* [ ] Implement `evaluation/bss_metrics.py` calculating:
  - Scale-Invariant Signal-to-Distortion Ratio (**SI-SDR**).
  - **Permutation Invariant Training (PIT)** optimal assignment ($\pi^*$).
* [ ] Run separation inference on the controlled mixtures generated in M1.
* [ ] Log inference runtime, processing time, RTF, and output peak amplitude.
* [ ] Verify output audio quality by listening: ensure vocal tracks are isolated without destructive cancellation.

### 5. Required Quantitative & Qualitative Results
* **Quantitative Result**: Calculated SI-SDR score (dB) demonstrating positive separation improvement over the raw mixture.
* **Qualitative Result**: A pair of separated audio files clearly demonstrating vocal separation of the two speakers.

### 6. Definition of Done (DoD)
- [ ] A real mixture `.wav` is ingested and successfully processed by Demucs.
- [ ] Separated single-speaker `.wav` files are generated, saved, and audibly verified.
- [ ] SI-SDR calculation with permutation-invariant matching executes against ground-truth references.
- [ ] At least one concrete quantitative SI-SDR result is logged and documented.
- [ ] Inference wall-clock time, audio duration, and basic memory footprint are recorded.
- [ ] The entire separation and evaluation workflow is 100% reproducible via script.
